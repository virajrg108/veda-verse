      "verseTitle": "Text 1:",
      "translation": "Śrī Nārada Muni said: A person able to cultivate spiritual knowledge should renounce all material connections, and merely keeping the body inhabitable, he should travel from one place to another, passing only one night in each village. In this way, without dependence in regard to the needs of the body, the sannyāsī should travel all over the world."
    },
    {
      "id": "sb_7_13_2",
      "verseTitle": "Text 2:",
      "translation": "A person in the renounced order of life may try to avoid even a dress to cover himself. If he wears anything at all, it should be only a loincloth, and when there is no necessity, a sannyāsī should not even accept a daṇḍa. A sannyāsī should avoid carrying anything but a daṇḍa and kamaṇḍalu."

      "id": "sb_7_13_3",
      "verseTitle": "Text 3:",
      "translation": "The sannyāsī, completely satisfied in the self, should live on alms begged from door to door. Not being dependent on any person or any place, he should always be a friendly well-wisher to all living beings and be a peaceful, unalloyed devotee of Nārāyaṇa. In this way he should move from one place to another."

      "verseTitle": "Text 5:",
      "translation": "During unconsciousness and consciousness, and between the two, he should try to understand the self and be fully situated in the self. In this way, he should realize that the conditional and liberated stages of life are only illusory and not actually factual. With such a higher understanding, he should see only the Absolute Truth pervading everything."

      "id": "sb_7_13_6",
      "verseTitle": "Text 6:",
      "translation": "Since the material body is sure to be vanquished and the duration of one’s life is not fixed, neither death nor life is to be praised. Rather, one should observe the eternal time factor, in which the living entity manifests himself and disappears."

      "id": "sb_7_13_7",
      "verseTitle": "Text 7:",
      "translation": "Literature that is a useless waste of time — in other words, literature without spiritual benefit — should be rejected. One should not become a professional teacher as a means of earning one’s livelihood, nor should one indulge in arguments and counterarguments. Nor should one take shelter of any cause or faction."

      "verseTitle": "Text 8:",
      "translation": "A sannyāsī must not present allurements of material benefits to gather many disciples, nor should he unnecessarily read many books or give discourses as a means of livelihood. He must never attempt to increase material opulences unnecessarily."

      "verseTitle": "Text 9:",
      "translation": "A peaceful, equipoised person who is factually advanced in spiritual consciousness does not need to accept the symbols of a sannyāsī, such as the tridaṇḍa and kamaṇḍalu. According to necessity, he may sometimes accept those symbols and sometimes reject them."

      "verseTitle": "Text 10:",
      "translation": "Although a saintly person may not expose himself to the vision of human society, by his behavior his purpose is disclosed. To human society he should present himself like a restless child, and although he is the greatest thoughtful orator, he should present himself like a dumb man."

There he found a great saintly person who was lying on the ground, covered with dirt and dust, but who was deeply spiritually advanced."

      "verseTitle": "Text 15:",
      "translation": "The advanced devotee Prahlāda Mahārāja duly worshiped and offered obeisances to the saintly person who had adopted a python’s means of livelihood.

      "translation": "Seeing the saintly person to be quite fat, Prahlāda Mahārāja said: My dear sir, you undergo no endeavor to earn your livelihood, but you have a stout body, exactly like that of a materialistic enjoyer.

      "translation": "My dear King, although you know everything, you have posed some questions, which I shall try to answer according to what I have learned by hearing from authorities.

      "verseTitle": "Text 28:",
      "translation": "In this way the conditioned soul living within the body forgets his self-interest because he identifies himself with the body.
