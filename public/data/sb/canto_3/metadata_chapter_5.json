      "translation": "He lies down on His own heart spread in the form of the sky, and thus placing the whole creation in that space, He expands Himself into many living entities, which are manifested as different species of life.

      "verseTitle": "Text 13:",
      "translation": "For one who is anxious to engage constantly in hearing such topics, kṛṣṇa-kathā gradually increases his indifference towards all other things. Such constant remembrance of the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa by the devotee who has achieved transcendental bliss vanquishes all his miseries without delay."

      "translation": "O sage, persons who because of their sinful activities are averse to the topics of Transcendence and thus ignorant of the purpose of the Mahābhārata [Bhagavad-gītā] are pitied by the pitiable. I also pity them because I see how their duration of life is spoiled by eternal time while they involve themselves in presentations of philosophical speculation, theoretical ultimate goals of life, and different modes of ritual."

      "verseTitle": "Text 23:",
      "translation": "The Personality of Godhead, the master of all living entities, existed prior to the creation as one without a second. It is by His will only that creation is made possible and again everything merges in Him. This Supreme Self is symptomized by different names."

      "id": "sb_3_5_24",
      "verseTitle": "Text 24:",
      "translation": "The Lord, the undisputed proprietor of everything, was the only seer. The cosmic manifestation was not present at that time, and thus He felt imperfect without His plenary and separated parts and parcels. The material energy was dormant, whereas the internal potency was manifested."

      "verseTitle": "Text 25:",
      "translation": "The Lord is the seer, and the external energy, which is seen, works as both cause and effect in the cosmic manifestation. O greatly fortunate Vidura, this external energy is known as māyā or illusion, and through her agency only is the entire material manifestation made possible."

      "verseTitle": "Text 28:",
      "translation": "Thereafter the mahat-tattva differentiated itself into many different forms as the reservoir of the would-be entities.

      "verseTitle": "Text 29:",
      "translation": "Mahat-tattva, or the great causal truth, transforms into false ego, which is manifested in three phases — cause, effect and the doer.

      "id": "sb_3_5_38",
      "verseTitle": "Text 38:",
      "translation": "The controlling deities of all the above-mentioned physical elements are empowered expansions of Lord Viṣṇu.

      "id": "sb_3_5_41",
      "verseTitle": "Text 41:",
      "translation": "The lotus feet of the Lord are by themselves the shelter of all places of pilgrimage. The great clear-minded sages, carried by the wings of the Vedas, always search after the nest of Your lotuslike face. Some of them surrender to Your lotus feet at every step by taking shelter of the best of rivers [the Ganges], which can deliver one from all sinful reactions."
